          The MediaStream Image Capture API is an API for capturing 
          images or videos from a photographic device. In addition 
          to capturing data, it also allows you to retrieve information 
          about device capabilities such as image size, red-eye reduction 
          and whether or not there is a flash and what they are currently set to.

Recently I had a need to add table rows dynamically when user clicks on a link in the Table cell. I wanted to look it like, I can expand and collapse the section such that, user can see the additional details on demand.

Here is a demo of it. I have used React hooks like `useState` and `useeffect` to achieve it. See the code section for more details.
